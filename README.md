<h3>San Antonio Waste Management Division:
Work Order Tracking System<h3>

As Part of Civ Tech San Antonio's initiative to support public agencies, our group focused on a problem set posed by the Solid Waste Management Department (SWMD): Waste management is one of the most pressing needs within a rapidly growing city, and as San Antonio’s population on the rise, the Solid Waste Management Department (SWMD) needs an agile, responsive system to appropriately manage those services. The SWMD currently has over 1 million different sized carts in circulation, and services more than 350,000 households within the San Antonio area.
Currently, SWMD operates on a paper-based data tracking system, and the City is eager to see a solution that has the latitude to revamp SWMD’s warehouse operations in three distinct areas: inventory management, work order management, and customer communication.

<br>
<h4>Goals of this project are to:</h4>
<br>
- Transition from a paper based inventory tracking system to a web based data tracking system for garbage carts.<br>
- Develop an interactive form to submit and track work orders.<br>
- Develop an interactive customer portal that displays the current users inventory of garbage carts and request forms to cancel or create additional garbage cart orders.<br>
